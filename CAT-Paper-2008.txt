Abdul, Bikram and Chetan are three professi anal traders who trade in shares of a company XYZ Ltd. Abdul
follows the strategy of buying at the opening of the day at 10 am and selling the whole Iot at the close of
the day at 3 pm. Bikram follows the strategy of buying at hourly intervals: 10 am, 11 am, 12 noon, 1 pm
and 2 pm, and selling the whole lot at the close of the day. Further, he buys an equal number of shares in
each purchase. Chetan follows a similar pattern as Bikram but his strategy is somewhat different. Chetan's
total investment am aunt is divided equally among his purchases. The profit or loss made by each investor
is the difference between the sale value at the close of the day less the investment in purchase. The
"returri' for each investor is defined as the ratio of the profit or loss to the investment am aunt e
as a percentage.

Language is not a cultural artifact that we learn the way we learn to tell time or how the federal
government works. Instead, it is a distinct piece of the biological makeup of our brains. Language is a
complex, specialized skill, which develops in the child spontaneously, without conscious effort or formal
instruction, is deployed without awareness of its underlying I ogi c, is qualitatively the same in every
individual, and is distinct from more general abilities to process information or behave intelligently. For
these reasons same cognitive scientists have described language as a psychological faculty, a mental
organ, a neural system, and a computational module. But I prefer the admittedly quaint term "instinct."

canopies made of silvery metal: either the two-cent cone or the four-cent ice cream pie. The two-cent

To summarize the Classic Maya collapse, we can tentatively identify five strands. I acknowledge,
however, that Maya archaeologists still disagree vigorously among themselves-in part, because the
different strands evidently varied in importance among different parts of the Maya realm; because
detailed archaeological studies are available for only same Maya sites; and because it remains puzzling
why most of the Maya heartI and remained nearly empty of population and failed to recover after the
collapse and after re-growth of forests.
With those caveats, it appears to me that one strand consisted of population growth o
available resources: a dilemma similar to the one foreseen by Thomas Malthus in 1798 and
out today in Rwanda (Chapter 10), Haiti (Chapter 11), and elsewhere. 1>s the arch o
Webster succinctly puts it, "Too many farmers grew too many crops on too much
Compounding that mismatch between population and resources was the second
deforestation and hill side erosion, which caused a decrease in the amount of us
when more rather than less farm I and was needed, and possibly exacerbate by
drought resulting from deforestation, by soil nutrient depletion and other soi I p
struggle to prevent bracken ferns from overrunning the fields.

w sti II have same other past societies to consider in this book before we switch our

co Canyon, Maya peak population numbers were followed swift I y by political and social coli apse.
Para II eli ng the eventual extension of agriculture from Easter Island's coastal I owlands to its uplands, and
from the Mimbres floodplain to the hills, COpan's inhabitants also expanded from the floodplain to the
more fragile hill slopes, leaving them with a larger population to feed when the agricultural boom in the
hills went bust. Like Easter Island chiefs erecting ever larger statues, eventually crowned by pukao, and
Iike Anasazi elite treating them selves to necklaces of 2, 00 0 turquoise beads, Maya kings sought to outdo
each other with more and more impressive tempi es, covered with thicker and thicker pi asterreminiscent in turn of the extravagant conspicuous

consumption by modern American CEOs. The passivity of Easter chiefs and Maya kings in the face of the
real big threats to their societies completes our list of disquieting parallels.
