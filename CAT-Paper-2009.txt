Another source of inefficiency is the fact that physicians have .obligations to many different groups: patients, students, faculty
members, referring physicians, third-party payers, and staffmembers,allofwhom have varied expectations. Satisfying the interests of one
group may alienate others. ·Patient care provides a common example. For the I>enefit of medical students, physicians may order too many
tests, prolong patient ｾｩｳｴＬ＠
or encourage experimental studies of a patient. If AMC faculty physkians were more aware of how much
treatments of specific illnesses cost; and of how other institutions treat patient conditions, they Would be better practitioners, and .the
educational and clinical care missions of AMCs would both be better served.
,
A bias toward specialization adds yet more inefficiency. AMCs are viewed as _institum?ns serving the gravest cases in need of the
most advanced treatments. The high number of specialty residents anq the presence of burn units, blood banks, and_ transplant centers
ｶ｡ｬｾ､ｴ･＠
this belief. Also present at AMCs, though less conspicuous, are facilities for ordinary primary care patients. In fact, many patients
choose to visit an AMC for primary care because they realize that any necessary follow-up can occur almost instantaneously: While AMCs
have emphasized cutting-edge specialty medicine, their more routine medical services need development and enhancement.
· A final contribution to inefficiency is organizational complace:ilcy. Until recently, most academic medical centers drew the public
nierely by ･ｾｩｳｴｮｧＮ＠

Founded at the dawn ofthe modem industrial era, the nearly forgotten Wonien's Trade Union League (WTUL) played an instrumental
Line role in advancing the cause of working womenthroughout,the early part of the twentieth century. In the face of considerable adversity,
the WTUL made a contribution far greater thaq did most historical footnotes.
The organization's successes did not come easily; conflict ｢･ｾｴ＠
the WTUL in many forms.
During those early days of American unions, organized labour was aggressively opposed .by both industry and government. The
WTUL, which represented a largely unskilled labour force, had little leverage against these powerful opponents. Also, because of th!! skill
level of its workers as well as inherent societal gender bias, the WTUL had ｧｲ･｡ｴｾｦｩ｣ｵｬｹ＠
finding allies among other unions. Even the large
and powerful American Federation ｯｦｌ｡｢ｾｵｲ＠
(AFL), which nominally took the WTUL.under its wing, kept it at a distance. Because the
AFL'S. power. stemmed from its highly skilled labour force, the organization saw little economic benefit in working with the WTUL. The
affiliation provided the AFL with political cover, allowing it to claim support for women workers; in return, the WTUL gained a potent but
largely absent ally.
The WTUL also had to.overcome internal (,iiscord. While the majority of the group's members were working women, a sizeable and
powerful minority consisted ofmtddle- and upperclass social reformers whose goals extended beyond labour reform. While workers argued
that ·the WTUL should focus its efforts on collective bargaining and working conditions, the reformers looked beyond the workplace,
seeking state and national legislation aimed at education reform and urban poverty relief as well as workplace issues.
Despite these obstacles, the WTUL accomplished a great deal. The organization was instrumental in the passage of state laws
mandating an eight-hour workday, a minimum ｷｾｧ･＠
for women, and a ban on child labour. It provided seed money to women who organized
workers in specific plants and industries, and also established strike funds and soup kitchens to support striking unionists. After the tragic
Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire of 1911, the WTUL launched a four-year investigation whose-conclusions _formed the basis of much
subsequent workpJace safety legislation. The organization also offered a political base for all reform-minded women, and thus helped
develop the.next generation of American leader-S. Eleanor Roosevelt was one of many prominent figures to emerge from the WTUL.
